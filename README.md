# proREADME

#### proREADME is the name of the end goal of this program

#### The idea is to make a README.md Which has style properly formatted, as has #### the idea of the point of the program.
#### All of index.js, .gitignore (which includes node_modules/  .DS_Store/ )
#### package.json as well package-lock.json, generateMarkdown.js (generateMarkdown has all of the files that should be ignored)

#### The other files, which have been created on my discretion, are an output/ folder and in it template.md which is how this README.md will function. Since we already have a README.md. We  don't want to replace it.
